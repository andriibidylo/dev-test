## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the URL of the Git repository.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the project directory:
cd <project-directory>
Replace <project-directory> with the name of your project folder.

3. Install Dependencies
Using npm:
npm install

4. Node.js:
v20.12.1^

5. Set Up Environment Variables
I've attached the .env file to the project specifically for this test project. Otherwise, it should be placed in .gitignore.

6. Run the development server:
Using npm:
npm run dev

7. Open (http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.
